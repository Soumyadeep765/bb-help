# Overview

SmartBot is an advanced class designed for bot developers. It simplifies handling user inputs, managing language translations, and structuring bot commands in a user-friendly way.&#x20;

The class embodies the principles of Bot Smart Architecture, which focuses on logic isolation, multi-language support, and simplicity.



## Key Principles of Smart Architecture

1. **Logic Isolation from Content**: Separates the logic of your bot from its content.
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Defaulting to English, but easily adaptable for other languages.
3. **Unified Command Structure**: Use single commands with multiple translations rather than language-specific commands.
4. **Externalized Text Management**: All texts, especially translatable ones, are kept outside the command code in language files.
5. **Language-Based Elements**: Elements like answers, aliases, and keyboards are defined in language files, not in the command.
6. **Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)**: One message per command and clarity in command naming.
7. **Command Naming Rules**: Clear and meaningful names for commands.
